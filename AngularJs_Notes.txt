AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It is a library written in JavaScript.

AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

AngularJS Extends HTML
AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.


AngularJS Directives
AngularJS directives are HTML attributes with an ng prefix.

The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.

AngularJS Expressions
AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written:
AngularJS expressions bind AngularJS data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.

AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.



AngularJS Module

var app = angular.module('myApp', []);

AngularJS controllers control applications:

AngularJS Controller
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.firstName= "John";
    $scope.lastName= "Doe";
}
);


Repeating HTML Elements
The ng-repeat directive repeats an HTML element:
The ng-repeat directive actually clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection.
